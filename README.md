# 2017OffSeasonVision

This is a quick demonstration of doing Object Detection using Haar Cascades. It will draw a red rectangle around the detected object.

It is currently using a face detection cascade. We would need to train a cascade for whatever the vision target is.

To Build:
```./gradlew build```

To run:
```./gradlew run```

There are many articles and videos on the web on how to train your own cascade....
